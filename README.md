AWS S3 Upload Lab using JAVA
======================

This is the code that I built on our Day 3 Amazon Developing with AWS course.

----

//TODOs to run the app

1) You must include the third-party JAR files which can also be found on AWS SDK, **Project Properties -> Build Path -> Add External JARs**

- commons-logging-1.1.1/commons-logging-1.1.1.jar
- httpcomponents-client-4.2.3/httpcore-4.2.jar
- httpcomponents-client-4.2.3/httpclient-4.2.3.jar
- jackson-core-2.1/jackson-core-2.1.1.jar
- jackson-databind-2.1/jackson-databind-2.1.1.jar
- jackson-annotations-2.1/jackson-annotations-2.1.1.jar
- commons-codec-1.3/commons-codec-1.3.jar

2) Modify the file **AwsCredentials.properties**

3) Modify the Bucketname, KeyName, filepath

4) Create dummy file that you will use on filepath
